# SightWords
A simple flash card web app to help young kids learn sight words.  Choose the color set and click Go.  If the word is correctly identified, click "Got It".  Otherwise, click "missed".  The missed words will continue to cycle until you have clicked "Got It" for all the words.
See the live app at https://bman511.github.io/SightWords/.
